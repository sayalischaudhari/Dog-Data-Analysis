# Dog-Data-Analysis

### Dataset Overview-

The dataset is from Higham et al. (1980), gives 9 skull measurement for different canine groups.

The variables-

•	X1 = length of mandible

•	X2 = breadth of mandible below 1st molar

•	X3 = breadth of articular condyle

•	X4 = height of mandible below first molar

•	X5 length of first molar, X6 = breadth of first molar

•	X7 = length of first to third molar inclusive (first to second for Cuon)

•	X8 = length from first to fourth premolar inclusive

•	X9 = breadth of lower canine

All measured in millimeters

### Analysis on Dog Dataset-

•	Applied Multivariate techniques to analyze Dog Data Set and found compelling insights. Applied K-means clustering to find which Canine Group IndianWolf is closely related to

•	Applied Factor Analysis and PCA analysis to reduce the dimensions of the data i.e find least number of columns that account for maximum variance

•	Created and applied LDA and Logistic Regression models to predict the gender of dogs with Species as Thaidogs

•	Created a Linear Regression model to predict Mandible length for Prehistoric Thai Dogs. Trained model had the accuracy of 95%
